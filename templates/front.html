        <h2>About Our Prediction Tool</h2>
        <p>The Diabetes Readmission Prediction Tool is designed to help healthcare providers make informed decisions
            about patient care and follow-up strategies. By analyzing various patient parameters, our system calculates
            the likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge.</p>
        <p>This tool considers multiple factors including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Admission Type ID, Discharge Disposition ID, and Admission Source ID are key indicators of the patient's
                entry, exit, and referral details in the hospital.</li>
            <li>Time in Hospital, Number of Lab Procedures, Procedures, and Medications reflect the patient's treatment
                and healthcare usage during their stay.</li>
            <li>Diabetes Med: Refers to whether the patient is prescribed specific diabetes-related medications like
                Metformin or Insulin. Metformin is a common medication for type 2 diabetes, while Insulin is often
                prescribed to manage blood sugar in type 1 or advanced type 2 diabetes.</li>
            <li>Number of Diagnoses helps identify co-existing conditions that may influence the patient's treatment
                plan.</li>
            <li>Level 1 Diagnostic 1: Refers to the main diagnostic category of the patient's condition, which in this
                case is Circulatory, suggesting a focus on heart or blood vessel-related health issues.</li>
            <li>Change: Indicates any change in the patient's treatment or condition during their hospital stay, with
                "0" representing no change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Background and Objectives</h3>
        <p>Diabetes mellitus is a major chronic disease that results in readmissions due to poor disease control. Here
            we established and compared machine learning (ML)-based readmission prediction methods to predict
            readmission risks of diabetic patients.</p>

        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>The dataset analyzed in this study was acquired from the Health Facts Database, which includes over 100,000
            records of diabetic patients from 1999 to 2008. After data preprocessing and normalization, multiple risk
            factors in the dataset were examined for classifier training to predict the probability of readmission using
            ML models. Various classifiers such as random forest, Logistic Regression, and decision tree ensemble were
            compared to determine the best predictive model.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>A total of 100,244 records were included for model construction. Twenty-three attributes, including race,
            sex, age, admission type, and drug use, were identified as significant modeling risk factors. The random
            forest model achieved the highest performance with the best AUC score among all classifiers.</p>
